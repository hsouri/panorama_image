# Panorama Image

# Introcduction

The purpose of this project is to stitch two or more images in order to create one seamless panorama image. Each image should have few repeated local features (∼ 30-50% or more, emperically chosen). The following method of stitching images should work for most image sets.

# Data Set

You need to capture two sets of images in order to stitch a seamless panorama. Each sequence should have at-least 3 images with ∼ 30-50 % image overlap between them. Feel free to check the sample images given to you in Data\Train\ folder.
