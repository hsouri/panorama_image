# Panorama Image

# Introcduction

The purpose of this project is to stitch two or more images in order to create one seamless panorama image. Each image should have few repeated local features (∼ 30-50% or more, emperically chosen). In this project, you need to capture multiple such images. The following method of stitching images should work for most image sets but you’ll need to be creative for working on harder image sets.
